‚∏ª

1. Objective

Create a web app that makes it fast and effortless to record expenses across multiple people.
	‚Ä¢	Each item can be assigned to one or more people.
	‚Ä¢	The app automatically calculates each person‚Äôs share and updates totals in real time.

No settle-up or payments in v1.
Focus is purely on recording and calculation.

‚∏ª

2. Target Users

	‚Ä¢	Users who need speed, clarity, and correctness when splitting bills.

	3.	Split With (multi-select chips from people row).
	‚Ä¢	Quick buttons: All / None / Invert.
